It's flu season again, which means a lot of your co-workers are out sick ...
but many have decided to stick around ... 
since the boss mentioned he'll be promoting someone soon ... 
Your goal is to complete your list of tasks by the end of the work day ...
to earn that promotion ...
Remember to be careful around the office though ...
You wouldn't want to catch the flu.
